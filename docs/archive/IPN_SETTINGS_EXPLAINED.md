# 🔧 SSLCommerz IPN Settings Configuration Guide

## What You're Seeing

You're in the **IPN Settings** page which is correct! This is where you configure how SSLCommerz sends payment notifications to your backend.

## ⚠️ Important: You Don't Need HTTP Listener

The page shows "IPN at HTTP Listener" but you actually don't need to configure this field for your setup because:

✅ Your callback URLs are already configured **in the transaction creation** (Step 1 of SSLCommerz integration)  
✅ SSLCommerz will use those URLs automatically  
✅ You only need the HTTP Listener if you want SSLCommerz to POST IPN data to a separate endpoint

## ✅ What You SHOULD Do Instead

The callback URLs are configured when you **create the transaction session** in your API code. Your Vercel backend already has this set up!

**Your code automatically sends these to SSLCommerz:**
- Success: `https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/success`
- Fail: `https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/fail`
- Cancel: `https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/cancel`

## 📋 Checklist for IPN Settings Page

### Option 1: Leave It Empty (Recommended - Your Current Setup)
- ✅ Leave "Enable HTTP Listener" **unchecked**
- ✅ This is fine because you're using the callback URLs in transaction creation
- ✅ Your code handles the responses correctly

### Option 2: Configure HTTP Listener (If You Want Extra Validation)
If you want to enable it:
1. Check "Enable HTTP Listener"
2. Enter: `https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/success`
3. Click Save

But this is **optional** since your code already handles payment validation!

## 🎯 What Happens Next

1. **Customer visits** → `https://autosparkbd.com/payment`
2. **Submits form** → POSTs to your proxy server
3. **Proxy forwards** → to Vercel backend
4. **Backend creates session** → sends callback URLs to SSLCommerz
5. **SSLCommerz returns** → payment gateway URL
6. **Customer redirected** → to SSLCommerz sandbox
7. **After payment** → SSLCommerz redirects to your callback URL
8. **Your backend** → validates and updates Supabase

## ✅ You Can Now Move to Task 2!

Your SSLCommerz configuration is complete because:
- ✅ Store ID: `autos69cccc023b067`
- ✅ Store Password: `REDACTED-ROTATE-REQUIRED`
- ✅ Callback URLs: Configured in your code
- ✅ Sandbox mode: Enabled

**No more SSLCommerz config needed!** 🎉

## 🚀 Next: Task 2 - Test Locally

Time to test your payment system! Run these commands:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start proxy server
npm run proxy

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Then open in browser:
http://localhost:5173/payment
```

See **QUICK_START_FINAL_STEPS.md** for the full testing checklist!
