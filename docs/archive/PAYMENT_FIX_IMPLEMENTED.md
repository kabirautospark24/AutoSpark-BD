# ✅ PAYMENT SYSTEM - COMPLETE FIX EXECUTED

## Status: Code Fixed & Deployed ✅ 
## Remaining: Manual Configuration (5-10 minutes)

## What Was Broken

You had **7 critical payment issues**:
1. ❌ Supabase edge function using FormData (not compatible with Deno)
2. ❌ SITE_URL pointing to localhost instead of production
3. ❌ Missing credential validation in backend
4. ❌ Hardcoded credential fallbacks (security risk)
5. ❌ Supabase secrets not set in dashboard
6. ❌ Vercel env var names wrong
7. ❌ SITE_URL not set in Vercel

## What's Fixed ✅

### Code Changes (All Deployed)
- ✅ Supabase: FormData → URLSearchParams (Deno-compatible)
- ✅ SITE_URL: localhost → https://autosparkbd.com
- ✅ Validation: Added explicit credential checks
- ✅ Security: Removed hardcoded fallbacks
- ✅ Compatibility: Added legacy env var name support (STORE_ID, STORE_PASS)

### Files Modified
1. `supabase/functions/init-ssl-payment/index.ts` - FormData fix
2. `api/payment/init.ts` - Validation + legacy support
3. `src/config/payment.ts` - Cleaned up hardcoded values
4. `supabase/.env.local` - Updated SITE_URL
5. `.env.local` - Added SITE_URL

### Build Status

## ⏳ What You Need To Do (Manual Setup)

### STEP 1: Configure Supabase Secrets (2 minutes)

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → init-ssl-payment → Settings → Secrets**

Add these 3 secrets:
```
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID = autos69cccc023b067
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD = REDACTED-ROTATE-REQUIRED
SITE_URL = https://autosparkbd.com
```

Click Deploy/Save.

### STEP 2: Configure Vercel Environment Variables (3 minutes)

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard → autospark-one → Settings → Environment Variables**

**Remove:**
- `STORE_ID` (old name)
- `STORE_PASS` (old name)

**Add:**
```
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID = autos69cccc023b067
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD = REDACTED-ROTATE-REQUIRED
SITE_URL = https://autosparkbd.com
```

All environments, then save.
