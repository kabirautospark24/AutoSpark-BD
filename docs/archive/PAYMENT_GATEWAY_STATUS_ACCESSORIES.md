## Payment Flow on Accessories Page

### Step 1: Add Accessories to Cart ✅
```
User selects accessories on AccessoriesPage
→ Adds to cart using CartContext
→ Cart state updated with items and total amount
```

### Step 2: Proceed to Payment ✅
```
User clicks "Checkout" button
→ Navigates to /payment route
→ PaymentPage displays one-page checkout form
→ User enters:
   - Full Name
   - Mobile Number (11-digit Bangladesh format)
   - District & Thana
   - Full Address
```

### Step 3: Initialize Payment ✅
```
User submits checkout form
→ Calls Appwrite Function: sslcommerz-api
→ Function validates payment data
→ Function creates order in Appwrite database
→ Function initializes SSLCommerz transaction
→ Returns redirect URL with unique transaction ID
```

### Step 4: SSLCommerz Gateway ✅
```
Browser redirects to SSLCommerz payment gateway
→ User selects payment method (Card, bKash, etc.)
→ User enters payment details
→ SSLCommerz processes payment
```

### Step 5: Payment Callback & Completion ✅
```
SSLCommerz sends IPN (Instant Payment Notification) callback
→ Appwrite Function validates IPN signature
→ Updates order status in database
→ Redirects user to:
   - https://autosparkbd.com/payment/success (if paid)
   - https://autosparkbd.com/payment/fail (if failed)
   - https://autosparkbd.com/payment/cancel (if cancelled)
```
