# Payment Gateway API - Test Results & Fix Summary

## Test Results (April 14, 2026)

### Test Command Executed
```bash
curl -X POST https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cart": [{"id": "test-item", "name": "Test Accessory", "price": 5000, "quantity": 1}],
    "total_amount": 5000,
    "customer_name": "Test User",
    "mobile": "01700000000",
    "address": "Test Address, Dhaka",
    "thana": "Dhaka",
    "district": "Dhaka"
  }'
```

### Result: ❌ API Endpoint Not Found (404)

**Response Headers:**
```
HTTP/2 404
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
x-next-error-status: 404
x-matched-path: /404
server: Vercel
```

**Issue Identified:**
The API endpoint was returning a Next.js 404 error page instead of being routed to the Vercel Function. This indicates:
- ✅ Domain is working (connection successful)
- ✅ SSL certificate is valid
- ❌ API routing not configured for Vercel Functions

**Root Cause:**
When using Vite instead of Next.js, Vercel needs explicit configuration to:
1. Build the Vite static site
2. Deploy the `/api` functions as serverless functions
3. Route requests to `/api/*` to the serverless functions (not the static site)

---

## Solution Applied ✅

### Updated `vercel.json`

Added configuration to explicitly set up API function routing:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputCommand": "dist",
  "framework": null,
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs24.x",
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:match*",
      "destination": "/api/:match*"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID": "@sslcommerz_store_id",
    "SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD": "@sslcommerz_store_password",
    "STORE_ID": "@store_id",
    "STORE_PASS": "@store_pass",
    "SITE_URL": "@site_url"
  }
}
```

**What Each Section Does:**

1. **buildCommand & outputDirectory**
   - Tells Vercel to run `npm run build` (Vite)
   - Output goes to `dist/` folder

2. **framework: null**
   - Disables Next.js auto-detection
   - Tells Vercel this is a custom framework (Vite)

3. **functions section (NEW)**
   - Tells Vercel which files are serverless functions
   - `api/**/*.ts` = all TypeScript files in `/api` directory
   - `runtime: nodejs24.x` = use Node.js 24
   - `memory: 1024` = allocate 1GB RAM per function
   - `maxDuration: 60` = functions can run max 60 seconds

4. **rewrites section (NEW)**
   - Tells Vercel: requests to `/api/:match*` should go to serverless functions
   - Not redirected, just routed internally

5. **env section**
   - References Vercel project secrets (stored in dashboard)
   - These are automatically injected at build/runtime

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `vercel.json` - Updated with API function configuration
2. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit `5cb49c0`)
3. ✅ Triggered Vercel rebuild

### Commits:
- `896e81e`: "fix: Configure Vercel functions routing for API endpoints"
- `e2d1ce5`: "docs: Add Vercel redeploy instructions for API configuration"
- `5cb49c0`: "chore: trigger vercel rebuild with updated api configuration"

---

## Current Status 🔄

**Deployment Status:** In progress

The rebuild has been triggered. Vercel should now:
1. ✅ Build the Vite static site to `dist/`
2. ✅ Detect and deploy the `/api/*.ts` files as serverless functions
3. ✅ Configure routing to send `/api/*` requests to serverless functions

**Expected Timeline:**
- ⏳ Build time: 1-2 minutes
- ⏳ Deployment: Automatic
- ✅ Status: Check https://vercel.com/dashboard

---

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Monitor Deployment (1-2 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select "autospark" project
3. Look for green checkmark ✅ next to latest deployment
4. When you see it, the build succeeded

### Step 2: Test the Payment Gateway API

Once deployed, test with the same curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://autospark-one.vercel.app/api/payment/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cart": [{"id": "test-item", "name": "Test Accessory", "price": 5000}],
    "total_amount": 5000,
    "customer_name": "Test User",
    "mobile": "01700000000",
    "address": "Test Address, Dhaka",
    "thana": "Dhaka",
    "district": "Dhaka"
  }'
```

**Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "GatewayPageURL": "https://securepay.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/gw.php?q=...",
  "sessionkey": "sessionkey12345..."
}
```

**If Still Getting 404:**
- Check Vercel dashboard deployment logs
- May need to manually redeploy via dashboard
- Contact Vercel support if persists

### Step 3: Test Full Payment Flow

Once API returns JSON successfully:
1. Go to https://autospark-one.vercel.app
2. Click Accessories
3. Add item to cart
4. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
5. Fill form and click "Confirm Order"
6. Should redirect to SSLCommerz payment page

---

## Technical Details

### Why This Was Needed

**Before**: Vercel was treating this as a Next.js project
```
Request → /api/payment/init → Next.js routing → 404 (no Next.js API route)
```

**After**: Vercel routes to serverless functions
```
Request → /api/payment/init → Vercel Function routing → api/payment/init.ts → SSLCommerz
```

### API Functions Deployed

- ✅ `api/payment/init.ts` - Initialize payment with SSLCommerz
- ✅ `api/payment/success.ts` - Handle success callback
- ✅ `api/payment/fail.ts` - Handle failure callback
- ✅ `api/payment/cancel.ts` - Handle cancellation

Each runs as a separate serverless function with:
- Node.js 24.x runtime
- 1GB memory
- 60 second timeout
- Automatic scaling (only pay when used)

---

## Important Notes

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables):
```
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID=autosparkbd0live
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD=REDACTED-ROTATE-REQUIRED
STORE_ID=autosparkbd0live
STORE_PASS=REDACTED-ROTATE-REQUIRED
SITE_URL=https://autospark-one.vercel.app
```

If any are missing, add them and redeploy!

### Building Locally

To verify everything works locally:

```bash
npm run build  # Creates dist/ folder with static site
```

The API functions will NOT work locally without a Vercel environment (they're serverless).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Still getting 404 | Wait 2 minutes for deployment, refresh browser |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Function error, check Vercel logs |
| JSON parsing error | SSLCommerz error, check credentials in Vercel |
| Timeout error | Function taking too long, may need to optimize |
