- mobile: string
- email: string
- address: string
- thana: string
- district: string
- total_amount: number
- cart_items: array
- session_id: string
- transaction_id: string
- status: string (pending/completed/failed/cancelled)
- created_at: timestamp

## Success Criteria

Your payment gateway is **complete** when:

✅ User can add items to cart from AccessoriesPage
✅ User can navigate to PaymentPage and fill form
✅ Form validates mobile number in Bangladesh format
✅ Form submission sends data to your backend
✅ Backend saves payment request to database

✅ User completes/cancels payment on SSLCommerz
✅ User redirected back to your success/fail/cancel page
✅ Database updated with transaction status
✅ Payment appears in your admin dashboard

## Common Questions

**Q: Which platform should I choose?**
A: Start with Firebase. It's the fastest to set up (2-3 hours total) and has excellent documentation.

**Q: Can I change platforms later?**
A: Yes. The payment form code is platform-agnostic. You only need to change the backend service.

**Q: What about email notifications?**
A: Can be added after basic payment flow works. See "Optional Features" section in implementation guide.

**Q: Do I need to use Vercel?**
A: No. You can deploy to any platform: Netlify, DigitalOcean, AWS, Heroku, or self-hosted.

**Q: How do I test SSLCommerz?**
A: Use test credentials first (use test endpoint), then switch to live credentials.

**Q: What's the cost?**
A: Firebase/Supabase have free tiers. Appwrite is free to self-host. Custom Node.js varies.
