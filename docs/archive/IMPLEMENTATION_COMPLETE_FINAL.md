```
CUSTOMER JOURNEY:
├─ Adds items to cart (AccessoriesPage)
├─ Clicks "Confirm Order"
├─ Fills payment form (PaymentPage)
│  ├─ Name validation (min 2 chars)
│  ├─ Phone validation (01XXXXXXXXX format)
│  ├─ Address validation (min 5 chars)
│  └─ District/Thana selection
├─ Submits form
│  └─ POST /functions/v1/init-ssl-payment
│     ├─ Authorization: Bearer token
│     ├─ Content-Type: application/json
│     └─ Body: cart, total, customer details
├─ Receives GatewayPageURL from backend
├─ Gets redirected to SSLCommerz payment page
├─ Completes payment at SSLCommerz
└─ Redirected back to:
   ├─ /payment/success (success page)

```

### Frontend Security
```
✅ Never calls SSLCommerz directly
✅ Uses backend API only
✅ Environment variables for config
✅ Input validation before send
✅ Error handling prevents exposure
```

### Backend Security
```
✅ Credentials in Supabase environment
✅ Input validation before processing
✅ CORS headers properly set
✅ HTTPS enforced
