## 🔄 THE COMPLETE PAYMENT FLOW (Now Working)

```
Frontend → Form.submit() → SSLCommerz
Result: Raw JSON displayed in browser
Effect: Customers cannot pay
```

### After (WORKING)
```
Frontend
    ↓
POST /functions/v1/init-ssl-payment (Backend)
    ↓
Backend validates + sends to SSLCommerz
    ↓
Gets GatewayPageURL from response
    ↓
Returns to frontend
    ↓
Frontend: window.location.href = GatewayPageURL
    ↓
User sees: SSLCommerz payment gateway
    ↓
User completes payment
    ↓
Redirected to: /payment/success (or fail/cancel)
    ↓
User sees: Clear confirmation + next steps
```
