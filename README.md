## Executive Summary

Auto Spark BD modernizes luxury car retail across North Bengal by providing a fast, bilingual online showroom that replicates the in-person premium purchase experience. The platform consolidates inventory, sales leads, and after-sales service into a single, scalable web application so dealers can convert visitors into customers faster and operate more efficiently across distributed locations.

This technical solution addresses market fragmentation and language friction with built-in bilingual support (English/Bengali), real-time lead generation via Supabase, and an integrated service booking engine. The result: measurable improvement in lead capture, faster time-to-contact, and a streamlined service workflow for both sales and operations teams.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why Supabase & Row Level Security (RLS)

- Supabase was chosen for its PostgreSQL foundation, realtime subscriptions, and first-class developer ergonomics. RLS policies are applied to enforce fine-grained access control directly at the database layer. This prevents accidental data leaks and simplifies backend logic: policies restrict row visibility by user role (public, authenticated, admin) and by resource ownership (e.g., a user may only see their service appointments).

- Benefits:
  - Centralized security: move authorization rules to the DB and reduce duplication in application code.
  - Realtime updates: lead notifications and appointment changes are emitted via realtime channels.
  - Simplified operational model: use Supabase Auth + RLS for most API protection needs without a custom server.

### Bilingual Architecture

- Language state is managed via a React Context (`contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`). The context exposes a compact API: current language, setter, and translation helper. All text nodes use this context to render EN/BN copies.

- For Bengali performance we use selective font subsetting: only the Bengali glyph subset is loaded when the user chooses Bengali, reducing payload and improving First Contentful Paint (FCP). Fonts are loaded with `font-display: swap` and conditionally imported via dynamic imports to avoid blocking the initial render.

### Performance & Lighthouse

- Key optimizations applied:
  - Image lazy-loading and responsive `srcset`/`sizes` usage for all car and product images.
  - Code-splitting via dynamic `import()` for large routes (Inventory, Vehicle Details) and non-critical components (3D viewers, maps).
  - CSS purging and Tailwind JIT for compact runtime CSS.
  - Critical CSS inlined for hero and above-the-fold sections.
  - Asset caching headers (set at deployment) and compressed bundles.

- Target Lighthouse scores: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90, Best Practices ≥ 90, SEO ≥ 90 (desktop baseline). Actual scores vary by page; Inventory and Vehicle Details are prioritized for high performance.

## Developer Experience (DX)

Everything in this repo is designed to be easy to run locally and to extend.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or pnpm)
- Supabase account and project
- (Optional) supabase CLI for local DB and migrations

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` (or use a `.env.local`) with these keys:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key   # for migrations and server tasks only
VITE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_api_key                # optional (Google Maps)
```

### Local Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:farhankabir133/autospark.git
cd autospark
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database: schema & migrations

- Schema highlights (Postgres tables): `vehicles`, `vehicle_images`, `vehicle_features`, `service_types`, `service_appointments`, `car_reservations`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `testimonials`, `users`.
- Migrations: use Supabase CLI or SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/` (if present). Example commands:

```bash
# install supabase CLI and login
supabase login
supabase db remote set <your-db-connection>
supabase db push --schema public
```

### Seeds & Admin

- Example seed data is provided in `src/hooks/vehicleDataAll.ts` for development and testing. For production, run SQL seed scripts or import CSVs via the Supabase UI.

### Testing & Typecheck

```bash
npm run typecheck   # run TypeScript checks
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm test            # If tests are added
```

## Deployment

- **Vercel (production):** the Vite bundle and the serverless functions in `api/` deploy to the `autospark-bd` Vercel project. Automatic CI/CD runs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — pushes to `main` deploy to production, pull requests get preview deploys.
- **Domains:** `https://www.autosparkbd.com` is canonical. The apex `https://autosparkbd.com` is attached to the same Vercel project and redirects to www. DNS records, registrar recovery, and monitoring are documented in **[docs/DNS-RUNBOOK.md](./docs/DNS-RUNBOOK.md)**.
- Ensure all `VITE_*` and server-only variables are set in the Vercel project environment (see `.env.example`).
- API routes are typechecked separately: `npm run typecheck:all`

---

## Security Notes

- RLS policies should be audited before production. Keep the service role key (`VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`) out of client-side code and CI logs.
- Rate-limit public endpoints and validate uploaded files (images) on the server-side or using Supabase Storage policies.
